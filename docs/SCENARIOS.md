# Headless scenarios

`mmorpg-scenarios` runs scripted multiplayer and control-plane scenarios without a GPU, network, wall clock or randomness. Use it to check server-side behavior that `scripts/smoke-native.py` can only reach through a GPU window.

```sh
cargo run -p mmorpg-scenarios --locked -- bots crates/mmorpg-scenarios/scenarios/bots/*.toml
cargo run -p mmorpg-scenarios --locked -- control-plane --json crates/mmorpg-scenarios/scenarios/control-plane/*.toml
```

Output is one digest line per event, ending with `PASS <name> …` or `FAIL <name> …` per file. `--json` prints the same lines as compact JSON objects with sorted keys, a `schema` (`mmorpg.bot-scenario/v1` or `mmorpg.control-plane-scenario/v1`) and a `type` (`scenario`, `step`, `tick`, `expect`, `error`, `result`). Exit status is 0 when every scenario passes, 1 when any fails and 2 for usage, file or format errors.

The runners own no rules. They drive the existing authorities and compare what those decide with the scenario's expectations.

| Runner | Drives | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bots` | `build_zone_host` → `game-server` `MatchHost`/`MatchRuntime` → `ZoneGameServerAdapter` → `mmorpg-core` physics, interest, combat and creature AI | Step outcomes and decoded player-scoped snapshots |
| `control-plane` | `HostRegistry`, `ZoneDirectory`, `HandoffRegistry`, and `FencedZoneRuntime` for writes | Step outcomes and distributed-world invariants after every step |

## Bot scenarios

A bot scenario advances one zone hosted with the shared Greyhaven Vale content, including its creatures and NPCs; bots spawn on the hub plaza (slot 0 at (−1550, 1250), then 100 units apart along +X). Ticks are stepped explicitly with `MatchRuntime::advance_tick`. Each bot's snapshot bytes come from `MatchRuntime::snapshot_for` and are decoded with `mmorpg_protocol::decode_snapshot`; a snapshot for another zone, tick or viewer is an error. Reconnect tokens are deterministic per bot.

```toml
name = "two-bots-move"      # [A-Za-z0-9_-]
zone = 1
ticks = 10                  # observations exist for ticks 1..=10
reconnect_grace_ticks = 120 # optional, default 120
digest_interval = 1         # optional; eventful ticks always print

[[bots]]
name = "alice"

[[steps]]                   # applied at `tick`, before it advances to tick + 1
tick = 0
bot = "alice"
action = "join"             # join | move | jump | select_target | start_attack | stop_attack | release_spirit | move_item | loot | disconnect | reconnect

[[steps]]
tick = 0
bot = "alice"
action = "move"
forward = 1                 # move requires forward, strafe (i8; the zone accepts -1..=1)
strafe = 0
facing = 16384              # and facing (u16 yaw, 65536 per turn; 0 faces +Z, 16384 faces +X)
seq = 5                     # optional (commands); default is the bot's next sequence
connection_epoch = 1        # optional (commands); default is the bot's current epoch
expect = "applied"          # optional; default is the action's success tag

[[steps]]
tick = 1
bot = "alice"
action = "select_target"
entity = "creature:108"     # select_target only: none | bot:<name> | creature:<id> | npc:<id>

[[expect]]                  # checked against the snapshot decoded at `tick`
kind = "sees"               # sees | not_sees | position | acknowledged | identity | visible_count | area
                            # | health | target | event | unit | inventory | copper | loot
bot = "alice"
target = "bob"
tick = 1                    # or by_tick = N (sees, event and unit), optionally with from_tick
```

Step outcome tags are `joined`, `applied`, `ignored_stale`, `disconnected`, `resumed`, and `rejected:<kind>`. Rejection kinds come from `game-server`: `invalid_sequence`, `stale_connection`, `simulation`, `unknown_token`, `already_connected`, `reconnect_expired`, and others. The runner adds `no_session` and `not_connected`. A step whose outcome differs from its `expect` fails the scenario.

| Expectation | Required fields | Passes when the bot's snapshot at the tick… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sees` | `target`, `tick` or `by_tick` | contains the target; with `by_tick`, at any tick in `from_tick..=by_tick` |
| `not_sees` | `target`, `tick` | does not contain the target |
| `position` | `position`, `tick`, optional `target` | shows the target (default: itself) at exactly `[x, y, z]` |
| `acknowledged` | `sequence`, `tick` | acknowledges that command sequence |
| `identity` | `tick` | shows the bot under the player ID from its first join |
| `visible_count` | `count`, `tick` | contains exactly `count` players, including itself |
| `area` | `area`, `tick`, optional `target` | shows the target (default: itself) inside the named core area (`greyhaven_vale::areas()`, the areas of the hosted vale content) |
| `health` | `health`, `tick` | shows the bot's own exact health |
| `target` | `entity`, `tick` | shows the bot's own target as `entity` (`none` for no selection) |
| `event` | `event`, `tick` or `by_tick`, optional `entity` | carries a feedback event of that kind (`damage_dealt`, `damage_taken`, `miss`, `died`, `evade`, `error:<code>`) about `entity`: whom the bot hit, who hit it, who died, who evaded, or the target an error concerned |
| `unit` | `entity` (not `none`), `state`, `tick` or `by_tick` | shows the unit `alive`, `dead` (a corpse or a dead player), `absent`, `in_combat`, `evading`, `targets_viewer` or `tapped_by_other` |

Error codes are `no_target`, `out_of_range`, `target_dead`, `not_attackable`, `you_are_dead`, `not_dead`, `invalid_target`, `too_many_intents`, `invalid_inventory_move`, `inventory_full`, `invalid_loot`, `not_loot_owner`, `empty_loot` and `money_overflow`. Units are named `bot:<name>`, `creature:<id>` (the spawn ID of the vale content) or `npc:<id>`.

A `jump`, `start_attack`, `stop_attack` or `release_spirit` step submits that bare command; `select_target` submits `SelectTarget` for its `entity`. Like `move`, every command takes optional `seq` and `connection_epoch` overrides. A well-formed command the zone refuses, such as attacking without a target, is still `applied`: the refusal arrives as an `error:<code>` event in the next snapshot. `select_target` of a bot that has not joined yet is `rejected:unknown_entity` and sends nothing.

A disconnected bot receives no snapshot, so any expectation on it fails. Other bots keep seeing it until reconnect grace expires.

Digest lines have the form `t=<tick> <bot> p<player> e<connection epoch> ack<sequence> (<x>,<y>,<z>) sees[<bots>] | …`. A bot's own combat state follows while it is not unhurt and idle: `hp<health>/<max>`, `dead`, `target=<unit>`, `attacking` and `in_combat`, then `events[…]` with the tick's feedback (`dealt:<unit>:<amount>`, `taken:<unit>:<amount>`, a trailing `!` for critical hits, `miss:<source>><target>`, `died:<unit>`, `evade:<unit>`, `error:<code>`). Ticks where any bot's combat state changes or events arrive are always printed. JSON tick lines carry the same state in `health`, `max_health`, `dead`, `in_combat`, `auto_attacking`, `target` and `events`.

## Control-plane scenarios

```toml
name = "lease-lifecycle"
lease_ttl_ticks = 100
heartbeat_ttl_ticks = 50

[[steps]]
at = 0                      # control-plane time; must not go backwards
op = "assign"
zone = 10
host = "host-a"
expect = "ok"               # optional; or rejected:<kind>
```

| `op` | Fields | Model call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `register`, `heartbeat` | `host` | `HostRegistry::register` / `heartbeat` |
| `expire_hosts`, `expire_leases` | none | `HostRegistry::expire` / `ZoneDirectory::expire` |
| `assign` | `zone`, `host` | `ZoneDirectory::assign` |
| `reassign` | `zone`, `expected_epoch`, `host` | `ZoneDirectory::reassign` |
| `renew`, `release` | `zone`, `host`, `epoch` | `ZoneDirectory::renew` / `release` |
| `write` | `zone`, `host`, `epoch` | one `advance_tick` through that grant's `FencedZoneRuntime` |
| `prepare` | `transfer`, `entity`, `source`, `destination` | `HandoffRegistry::prepare` |
| `accept` | `transfer`, destination `zone`/`host`/`epoch` | `HandoffRegistry::accept` |
| `commit` | `transfer`, source `zone`/`host`/`epoch` | `HandoffRegistry::commit` |

Leases are named by identity `(zone, host, epoch)`. `source` and `destination` are inline tables: `{ zone = 10, host = "host-a", epoch = 1 }`. Each grant gets its own fenced runtime, so a host can keep trying to write after losing its lease. Rejection kinds are the `ControlPlaneError` variants in snake case, such as `stale_lease`, `lease_expired`, `zone_already_assigned`, `lease_owner_mismatch`, `transfer_id_collision`, `entity_transfer_in_progress` and `transfer_not_accepted`.

After every step the runner reads the directory, epoch floor and handoff records, then checks:

- `single_writer`: at most one granted lease per zone is currently valid, no zone epoch was granted twice, and every directory owner came from a grant;
- `epoch_fenced`: a successful fenced operation presented the current, unexpired epoch; epoch floors never regress; a rejected operation changed no state;
- `handoff_idempotent`: a transfer keeps its ticket and never regresses, repeating a reached phase changes nothing, and each entity has at most one unfinished transfer;
- `retire_after_accept`: a transfer is committed, which retires the source, only after acceptance was observed.

Step lines show owners as `zone<id>=<host>@<epoch><<deadline>`. Violations print `INVARIANT FAIL <name>: <detail>` and fail the scenario. Unit tests in `src/control_plane.rs` feed each check a violating state.

## Expected outputs

Every `scenarios/<tool>/<name>.toml` has a `<name>.expected` text output. `cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked` requires each checked-in scenario to pass and reproduce its expected output byte for byte. After an intentional change, regenerate the files and review the diff:

```sh
MMORPG_SCENARIOS_UPDATE=1 cargo test -p mmorpg-scenarios --test scenarios --locked
```

## Limits

- The bot runner covers one zone per scenario and every command of wire version 4 (`choose_class` with `class` and `sex`, `use_ability` with `ability` and an optional `entity`, `cancel_cast`), plus `resource` expectations on the bot's exact class resource. `class-abilities` walks a Warden, a Ranger and an Arcanist in a column along the `vale-wolf-hunt` route to Timber Wolf 108 and checks class choice and refusal order, rage from swings, focus and mana regeneration with the five-second rule, the global cooldown, the Aimed Shot cooldown, Firebolt's cast, a movement interrupt, a cancelled cast and an overlapping cast. `vale-wolf-hunt` walks a bot from the hub into Wolfrun Woods along trunk-grid lines: it kills Timber Wolf 108 (aggro, out-of-range and refused attacks, damage both ways, death and corpse), then dies to Timber Wolf 106, which evades home, and releases its spirit to the graveyard with half health. Its steps rely on the vale's deterministic creature levels and wander paths; content changes that move creatures need the scenario retuned. `browser-local-session` scripts the browser demo's session (enter, camera-relative run and strafe, jump arc, area, leave, re-enter) through the hosted runtime. `mmorpg-wasm`'s host tests replay the same steps against the WASM local host and `MatchRuntime` and require byte-identical projections every tick while the player is joined (ticks 1–44 and 51–54). Leaving is modelled differently: the local host removes the unit at once, the hosted runtime after reconnect grace, so the away ticks are not compared. The scenario file and that test are separate copies of the steps; changing one needs the same change in the other.
- Scenarios run in process. Transport framing, datagram size limits, TLS and real reconnect timing are not covered. `scripts/smoke-native.py` and `mmorpg-client`'s loopback test still cover those.
- A network mode against `mmorpg-zone-host` is not implemented. The reusable client session lives in `mmorpg-client`, which depends on wgpu and winit unconditionally.
- The control-plane runner checks the in-memory reference model. It does not check a distributed deployment.

### Inventory vocabulary

`move_item` steps require `source_slot`, `destination_slot` (`u8`) and `quantity`
(`u16`), and support the same sequence/connection overrides as other commands.
`inventory` expectations require `inventory_revision` and `sheet` (presence).
For a present sheet, optional `slot`, `item` and `quantity` are supplied together;
empty slots use item/quantity zero. Expectations read decoded self projections.
The `inventory-resume` scenario checks splitting, refused partial swaps, duplicate
sequences, stale connection epochs, resume, merging, periodic sheets and isolation
from another player's bag.

### Corpse loot vocabulary

`loot` steps require `creature` (`u32` spawn ID) and `died_at` (`u64` death tick),
with the usual sequence/connection overrides. `copper` expectations require
`copper` and `tick`. `loot` expectations require `sheet` (presence) and `tick`;
a present sheet also requires `creature` and `died_at`. All read decoded player
projections. No scenario command supplies money or item rewards.

`corpse-loot-resume` kills wolf 108 at tick 912, refuses a wrong death fence,
settles two copper/two Torn Fur once, refuses duplicate and stale claims, resumes
the same player across connection epochs, rejects the old connection, and sees
the periodic complete bag at tick 920. Existing hunt/scenario outputs stay
unchanged; copper/loot expectations add explicit observations to this scenario.
